***Rationale**: We believe that the student who wants to stop smoking will find a general tracking application very useful. They would like a habit-tracking device that can incentivize, analyze, set goals, and show their progress. Their goal is to eventually stop smoking, so this tracking device will help them work towards this goal by allowing them to input their daily progress and how they feel.
