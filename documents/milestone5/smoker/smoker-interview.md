## Debriefing:
> User thought that the application was extremely straightforward. However, she made one suggestion to improve the application further:
  - User did not like how upon creating a new project, she was immediately prompted to make a new entry
  - As a result, user created an empty entry on the first try because she did not understand she needed to fill it out immediately
