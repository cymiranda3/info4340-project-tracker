# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

**1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.**

Project Name: **tequila-mockinbirds**

__Members:__
* Hamed Rabah (hr277)
* Hanna Arfine (ha264)
* Jessica Prague (jnp49)
* Jintana Cunningham (jc2747)
* Constantin Miranda (cym8)
* Ellen Xu (ex24)

**2. To what goals do we all commit?**
* We will all do the work we were assigned for the week.
* We will all **give it our best!**
* We all want to do well in the class, and we all agree to put in the effort to do so.
* Members will review each other’s work each week during the weekly meeting and check in about future deliverables and goals in order to fulfill these standards.
* At weekly stand-up meetings → discuss progress made on deliverables for the previous day. During each meeting, we will assemble a list of action items to keep the project moving forward.

**3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)**
* Work will be distributed evenly--make sure everyone is engaged and that all diverse opinions are being respected. The team has no true leader, and all of our opinions matter equally. As above, decisions will be made by majority or by discussion until a majority is reached.
* Decision-making policy: Decisions will be discussed and we will use majority rules
* Record-keeping: Members will have access to a shared Google drive folder and record keeping responsibilities will rotate
* All members will complete assignments and tasks on time. Each member will communicate with the team for each milestone. All members are expected to complete their assigned tasks with 100% quality effort and commitment.


**4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?**
* Day, time, and place for meetings: Weekly meetings will occur on Fridays at 2:30pm in eHub.
* Method of communication: Slack, emails, in-person meetings and during class. In case of emergencies, communicate with the team to notify everyone of the temporary unavailability.

**5. How will we communicate and work with our client?**
* We will communicate and work with our client via emails and in-person meetings once a week.

**6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.**
* Role 1: **Designer**: Deals with all things styling and design.
* Role 2: **Liason**: Primary communicator with client
* Role 3: **Coder**: (2 people): In charge of making sure the code is right and organized well
* Role 4: **Organizer**: Makes sure we are on time with deadlines and milestones
* Role 5: **Submitter**: Makes sure that everything is submitted & pushed on time. Helps the team handle push/pull errors.
* Overall, all of us will equally contribute to all parts of the group project.


**7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?**
* We will make sure we are on time and come prepared to the meetings so we are all engaged, or, if you can’t, clearly communicate. Five minutes is our flex time--if you’ll be more late than that, just let the rest of the team know. If there is an emergency, let the group know. Communication is really key here.
* If a team member appears not to be contributing equally or fails to deliver what was promised, we will tell him/her to put in the extra effort to work harder, since everyone's grades are affected.
* Each team member will communicate concerns and offer assistance/ constructive feedback. Problem will be addressed calmly and criticism will not be taken personally
* Ask why this standard isn’t being met: what’s the context? Is there anything the team can do to help?
* In the case we see behavior that is not productive to the functioning of the group, we will brainstorm new ways of allocating work, and re-prioritization of tasks as needed
* In the case that the group is able to collectively address recurring issues, we will then bring this up to the TA or Kyle


**8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?**
* When we disagree, we'll talk everything out in-person
* We'll weigh the pros and cons of each decision and try our best to decide based on that. If there's anyway to get the client's input about a decision, then the client gets the final say in whatever decision.

**9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?**
* In the beginning of every meeting, we'll skim the contract over to ensure that we are following it.
* If problems occur, we will re-visit the contract.


**10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)**
* We are all going out to eat at the end of the project!
* The person with the most commits gets to choose the location :)
