# Target Audiences


Potential Tracking Activities: Track sleep activity, nutrition, and fitness, productivity (task completion), habit tracker (track smoking, screen time, musician)

### **Target Audience #1: Person who who wants to stop smoking**

*Rationale*: We believe that the **person who wants to stop smoking** will find a general tracking application very useful. They would like a habit-tracking device that can incentivize, analyze, set goals, and show their progress. Their goal is to eventually stop smoking, so this tracking device will help them work towards this goal by allowing them to input their daily progress and how they feel.

*How we'll have access to this population*: We can access this population by posting a survey on Facebook, which looks for people seeking to quit smoking.

### **Target Audience #2: Person who wants to learn how to play an instrument**

*Rationale*: We think that a **musician looking to improve their musical abilities** would find a general tracking app useful for learning new pieces, new intstruments, or simply tracking variations on ways they play a piece. A habit-tracking app would not only help motivate them to accomplish goals, but also measure their progress and their variations on pieces. 

*How we'll have access to this population*: We can speak to musicians in Lincoln Hall.

### **Target Audience #3: A sprint football player who needs to lose weight **

*Rationale*: Sprint football players have to meet a weight limit before each game, so losing weight and keeping track of calorie consumption is is important. The solution has to have way to input calorie consumption, as well as track their schedule and check off days they meet their fitness goals (such as days spent working out (as well as what muscle group was worked out - leg day, arm day, cardio, etc.) and what days were spent practicing football. 

*How we'll have access to this population*: We will ask mutual friends to connect us with players on the sprint football team and set up interviews through these introductions.
