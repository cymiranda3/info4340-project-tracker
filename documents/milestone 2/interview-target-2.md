**Target Audience #2: Person who wants to learn how to play an instrument**

***Rationale:** We think that a **musician looking to improve their musical abilities** would find a general tracking app useful for learning new pieces, new intstruments, or simply tracking variations on ways they play a piece. A habit-tracking app would not only help motivate them to accomplish goals, but also measure their progress and their variations on pieces.*

***How we'll have access to this population**: We can speak to musicians in Lincoln Hall.*

  - A lot of times he texts himself things he needs to do. And he’ll keep it unopened and remember later
