**Target Audience #3: A sprint football player who needs to lose weight**

***Rationale:** Sprint football players have to meet a weight limit before each game, so losing weight and keeping track of calorie consumption is is important. The solution has to have way to input calorie consumption, as well as track their schedule and check off days they meet their fitness goals (such as days spent working out (as well as what muscle group was worked out - leg day, arm day, cardio, etc.) and what days were spent practicing football.*

**How we'll have access to this population:**
- We will ask mutual friends to connect us with players on the sprint football team and set up interviews through these introductions.
