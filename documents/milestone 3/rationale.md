Our app shows an emoticon indicating how the project is going, representing the frequency with which they create entries. Our initial user interviews indicated a need to be incentivized to accomplish their task; Savannah, our guitar persona, expressed that she needs to be motivated in order to actually practice her guitar. The emoji system accomplishes this by creating a streak system that users do not want to disappoint. Additionally, not only does this incentive people to use the app to continue their streaks, but also it addresses the user need for an update at a glance.

Our user interviews revealed that people generally want to invest as little time as possible into tracking their activities; they want a quick, straightforward approach to tracking that requires little effort and shows results at a glance. With this in mind, we give users an overview of all their progress on all their projects on the home page, indicating their development via the emoticon system.  

When the user creates a project, they have the option to add a field tracking specific measurements. There is a list of suggested presets to select from, helping indicate to users some examples of what they may want to track. Users also have the option to add their own custom field. We also added a line of clarifying test explaining this field, per our findings in user testing where some users were a bit confused about this field.

When viewing an entry, we decided a simple calendar view and list of entries best suited user needs, as they provide a quick visual overview of progress as well as accessibility to former entries. Our initial user interviews placed a particular emphasis on deadlines; for instance, Bill, our football persona, needs to analyze his progress in relation to his training deadline. This combination of calendar and detailed entries meets Bill's needs, as it both indicates progress over time and provides easy access to his more detailed documentation.
